# casper-rust-sdk

Rust SDK for casper-node 2.0+.  This library is designed to be utilised whenever an agent needs to interact with either [casper-node](https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node) or a [casper-sidecar](https://github.com/casper-network/casper-sidecar). Examples of such agents are off-chain middleware & network testing tools.

**NOTE** - The library specifically targets [casper-node](https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node) 2.0+, i.e. it is does **not** support the 1.X series.
